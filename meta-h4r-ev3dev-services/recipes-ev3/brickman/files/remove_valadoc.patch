-# Call the module using "find_package(Valadoc) from within your CMakeLists.txt.
-#
-# The following variables will be set after an invocation:
-#
-#  VALADOC_FOUND       Whether valadoc has been found or not
-#  VALADOC_EXECUTABLE  Full path to the valadoc executable if it has been found
-#  VALADOC_VERSION     Version number of the available valadoc
-##
-
-
-# Search for the valadoc executable in the usual system paths.
-find_program(VALADOC_EXECUTABLE
-  NAMES valadoc)

-# Handle the QUIETLY and REQUIRED arguments, which may be given to the find call.
-# Furthermore set VALADOC_FOUND to TRUE if Valadoc has been found (aka.
-# VALADOC_EXECUTABLE is set)
